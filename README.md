# Homework 1

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio page. I took 3 html pages, linked them together in the navigation bar using unordered list format. I took liberties with the style (approved by instructors) to challenge myself. I utilized HTML tags, SCSS compiling and variables, Google fonts, different types of positioning (flex, relative, absolute), and worked with other concepts that we are addressing in class. I haven't hooked up the form to a real, validated submission but that will come. 

## Extras
The following were addressed in this homework
* HTML doc with appropriate tags 
* Relative style links
* Creating form using HTML5 elements
* Sass usage 
* Sass compiling in terminal
* Creating and using Sass variables
* Google fonts
* Flexbox layout
